# Cybersecurity Lab Portfolio



Welcome! This repository contains my hands-on practice

Each folder represents a lab or practical exercise I've completed.  
For each lab, I document:

- What the lab was about  
- Tools I used  
- Important commands  
- Key screenshots (of my own work)  
- What I learned and key takeaways

## Labs

- Lab 01 – Network Traffic Analysis (Wireshark, tcpdump)
- Lab 02 – Log Analysis (AWS VPC Flow Logs)
- Lab 03 – Password Auditing (John the Ripper, hashcat)
- (More labs coming as I progress...)
