# Lab 02 – Log Analysis

## Lab Focus
Analyze network activity by reviewing traffic summaries from AWS cloud instances, identifying unusual or outlier conversations, and comparing those findings with packet-level data captured through tools such as tcpdump and Wireshark. This lab develops skills in spotting abnormal patterns, validating observations across different data sources, and strengthening foundational network analysis techniques.
